# Draw Chat

## Description

Draw Chat is a messaging platform, but you can't send normal messages. Instead, you can only send 5x5 drawings made up of colored (10 color choices) squares.

## Features

Right now you can only have one on one messages and there is real time updating (kinda broken).

## Technologies

For the frontend I used React, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and Vite. The backend uses Express, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL as the database. For the real time communication I used Socket.IO.

## Deployment

The app is deployed using Docker! You can use the Docker Compose file if you want to run this locally.
